Experiment I did while learning about decision trees and random forests

# This algorithm uses linear model to train it with evolutionary tree

Test run stdout:

```ruby

p.s. I think this algorithm is suitable for any model, for example, reinforcement learning agents, transformer models, diffusion models and etc. with a bit of correction
