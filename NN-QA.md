Train data for neural net

![Train data](https://github.com/AlephVenXm/Main/blob/main/data.png)

Result

Another test... yea

If it predicts non sense answers know: gradients and neural nets are random by their conception...

Or i'm bad at making good models


p.s. if you wanna make it predict answers for multiple question feel free to change this algorithm

For example: make an array with arrays which will contain questions and answers ---> different question ---> different array

Do not forget to change shape of input and output then...

Also if you know how GPT works even than me: add attention and embedding layers to mdl
